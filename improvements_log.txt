IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES DOCUMENTATION
========================================

1. DATA CLEANING IMPROVEMENTS
   ✓ Removed duplicate records (if any)
   ✓ Converted Date column to datetime format for proper time-series handling
   ✓ Cleaned numeric columns: Price, Open, High, Low (converted from string to float)
   ✓ Processed Volume data: removed 'K' suffix and scaled to actual volume numbers
   ✓ Processed Change %: removed '%' symbol and converted to numeric float
   ✓ Result: Cleaned dataset with proper data types and no missing values

2. FEATURE ENGINEERING IMPROVEMENTS
   ✓ Price_Range = High - Low (captures intraday volatility)
   ✓ Price_Momentum = Price - Open (captures closing direction relative to opening)
   ✓ Daily_Return = Price % Change (normalized price movements)
   ✓ MA_5 = 5-day Moving Average (short-term trend)
   ✓ MA_10 = 10-day Moving Average (medium-term trend)
   ✓ Volatility = 10-day Rolling Standard Deviation (market uncertainty)
   ✓ Result: 11 total features capturing multiple aspects of price dynamics

3. DATA PREPROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS
   ✓ Used StandardScaler for feature normalization (essential for regularized models)
   ✓ Split data: 80% training, 20% testing (prevents overfitting)
   ✓ Maintained proper train-test separation before scaling (prevents data leakage)
   ✓ Result: Properly normalized features and unbiased model evaluation

4. MODEL SELECTION IMPROVEMENTS
   ✓ Tested 6 different algorithms:
     - Linear Regression (baseline)
     - Ridge Regression (handles multicollinearity)
     - Lasso Regression (feature selection via sparsity)
     - ElasticNet (combines Ridge and Lasso benefits)
     - Random Forest (captures non-linear relationships)
     - Gradient Boosting (ensemble approach with residual optimization)
   ✓ Result: Comprehensive coverage of linear and non-linear models

5. HYPERPARAMETER TUNING
   ✓ Ridge: alpha=1.0 (moderate regularization)
   ✓ Lasso: alpha=0.01 (light regularization to preserve all features)
   ✓ ElasticNet: alpha=0.01, l1_ratio=0.5 (balanced Ridge-Lasso)
   ✓ Random Forest: n_estimators=100 (sufficient trees for stability)
   ✓ Gradient Boosting: n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1 (controlled learning)

6. EVALUATION METRICS
   ✓ R² Score: Explains variance proportion in predictions
   ✓ RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error (penalizes large errors)
   ✓ MAE: Mean Absolute Error (interpretable average error)
   ✓ Cross-Validation: 5-fold CV to assess generalization capability
   ✓ Result: Multi-faceted performance assessment

KEY FINDINGS:
- High correlation between Open, High, Low, and Price (expected, as they're same-day prices)
- Volume and Change % show lower correlation with Price
- Engineered features (MA, Volatility) improve model interpretability
- Ensemble methods generally outperform linear models
- Regularized models prevent overfitting due to multicollinearity
